This project is a Codebasics assignment I worked on, focused on analyzing hotel data for Atliq Hotel. The goal was to examine different datasets related to the hotel's performance, as itâ€™s currently facing challenges in the market with declining revenue. By exploring, cleaning, transforming the data, and generating insights, I aimed to provide Atliq Hotel with a clear understanding of its issues and suggest strategies for improvement.

I followed these steps in my approach:

Data Exploration: I reviewed the datasets to get a clear understanding of the information.
Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data to ensure accuracy, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: I adjusted the cleaned data to add useful features, like calculating occupancy rates.
Analysis and Insights: I analyzed the transformed data to uncover patterns and potential factors behind the revenue drop.
