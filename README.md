This project focuses on analyzing multiple datasets related to the performance of Atliq Hotel, which is currently facing challenges in the market and experiencing a decline in revenue. By conducting data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and generating insights, I performed an in-depth analysis to provide valuable information for Atliq Hotel. Through data exploration, I gained insights into the key variables and assessed data quality. I then cleaned the datasets to ensure data integrity. Additionally, I transformed the datasets to derive meaningful features, including calculating the occupancy rate. By analyzing occupancy rates and other key metrics, I identified revenue patterns and potential market challenges. The generated insights and recommendations aim to assist Atliq Hotel in understanding the causes of the revenue decline and implementing strategies for improvement.
